Let $X \in \{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$ represent the random variable, denoting the number of similar chocolates in the picked chocolates\\
Here, we can neglect X=1 because there can't be one similar object. \\
\begin{align}
    \pr{X\geq2}&+\pr{X=0}=1\\
    \pr{X=0}&=\frac{10.9.8.7.6}{10^5}\\
    \pr{X=0}&=0.3024\\
    \pr{X\geq 2}&=1-\pr{X=0}\\
    &=1-0.3024\\
    &=0.6976
\end{align}
